copy the directory P1 to your local directory.
cd to P1. Execute all test cases under xtratestcases/ from P1.
'.in' contains the test cases. Execute them in batch mode.
'.out' contains the expected output. 
'.desc' constains the description.

Some '.in' file may contain strings like '<path to P1>'. Replace this with the 
absolute path of P1 from the root.  We have automated script to test your program. 
If your program prints anything additional or different than the expected for a 
test case, your program would fail the automated testing for that test case.

Additional test cases are in testcases.txt, and testcase-2-longcmd.txt. 
The test case with a long command has more weightage. So, make sure your program passes it.
